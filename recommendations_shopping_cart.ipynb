    "# Description of the project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formulation of the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition, participants are asked to solve the problem of predicting the next user order (regardless of the specific moment in time when this order will occur). A user's order consists of a list of unique product categories, regardless of how many products of each category they have taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The train.csv training sample consists of the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* user_id - unique user id\n",
    "* order_completed_at - order date\n",
    "* cart - list of unique categories (category_id) that the order consisted of\n",
    "\n",
    "As a prediction, for each user-category pair, return 1 if the category will be present in the user's next order, or 0 otherwise. The list of categories for each user contains all the categories that he has ever ordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample_submission.csv submission example:\n",
    "Not all users from the training data are included in the test, as some of them did not order anything after the cutoff date.\n",
    "\n",
    "* id - row identifier - consists of user_id and category_id separated by a semicolon: f'{user_id};{category_id}'.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Due to the peculiarities of the Kaggle InClass checking system, it is not possible to use the user_id, category_id columns as an index separately*\n",
    "* target - 1 or 0 - whether this category will be present in the user's next order\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric for this competition is FScoreBeta with beta = 1, which gives a regular F1-Score. \n",
    "The F1 score, commonly used in information retrieval, measures accuracy using the statistics precision p and recall r. Precision is the ratio of true positives 𝑡𝑝 to all predicted positives 𝑡𝑝+𝑓𝑝. Recall is the ratio of true positives to all actual positives 𝑡𝑝+𝑓𝑛. \n",
    "\n",
    "The F1 score is given by:\n",
    "' 𝐹1=2𝑝⋅𝑟𝑝+𝑟  where  𝑝=𝑡𝑝𝑡𝑝+𝑓𝑝,  𝑟=𝑡𝑝𝑡𝑝+𝑓𝑛 '\n",
    "\n",
    "The F1 metric weights recall and precision equally, and a good retrieval algorithm will maximize both precision and recall simultaneously. Thus, moderately good performance on both will be favored over extremely good performance on one and poor performance on the other"
