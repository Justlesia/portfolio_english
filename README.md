List of projects:
| Title | Description | Tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Competition solution on Kaggle for MegaFon Accelerator](https://github.com/Justlesia/portfolio_ds/tree/main/%D0%9E%D1%82%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BA%20%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2.%20%D0%94%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%20%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2) |  It is necessary to build a model that predicts which of the three segments (0,1,2) each subscriber belongs to. Prediction accuracy is evaluated by the macro-f1_score metric. Public/Private distribution - 50%/50%.
[The approach described in the notebook allowed me to take 3rd place on the leaderboard.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mf-accelerator/leaderboard)
