| Title | Description | Tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Competition on Kaggle for SberMarket](https://github.com/Justlesia/portfolio_english/blob/main/recommendations_shopping_cart.ipynb) | It is necessary to build a model that can guess what the user will want to order next. | python, numpy, recommender systems|
| [Competition on Kaggle for MegaFon Accelerator](https://github.com/Justlesia/portfolio_english/blob/main/megafon_classify_kiseleva-Pub.ipynb) |  It is necessary to build a model that predicts which of the three segments (0,1,2) each subscriber belongs to. Prediction accuracy is evaluated by the macro-f1_score metric.
